					Programming has been my passion since childhood. At the age of 12, I began learning to code in Java with the goal of creating Minecraft Mods, although my initial attempts were not successfulðŸ¤£. After getting accepted into a university to study Computer Science, my love for programming only grew stronger. I continued to code and learn, and today, I am a skilled developer with a deep understanding of various programming languages and frameworks as well as experience of developing commercial applications that serve millions of users.
